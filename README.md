# 	Internal ballistic reconstruction of hybrid rocket engine.

This program works for hybrid rocket engine.
#
Function:
#
Help to reconstructe internal ballistic of hybrid rocket with experiment data.
#
Reconstructed data include o/f ratio, mass flow rate of fuel, grain port diameter with time variation history.
#
Input test data:  chamber pressure, mass flow rate of oxidizer, total mass of fuel grain, initial grain port diameter, propellent properties.
#
** To execute this program, NASA CEA has to be place in the same folder.
#
** Theoretical value of Cstar is calculated from NASA CEA.
